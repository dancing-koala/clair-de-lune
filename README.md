# Claire De Lune

An android application showing a full moon every day.

*Disclaimer: the app is no way perfect nor optimized as hell, I made it so it works & does what it is supposed to.*

## Why

My girlfriend loves the full moon, so now she can see one every day.

## Technology

Made using Kotlin & mostly buzzword-compliant/hype-driven technologies for building a very simple Android app.
